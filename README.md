## Invoice Generator:

   The invoice generator is a python script that will collect the data from a data frame with the impressions of a specific programmer from
a specific time period and generate a invoice based on an old invoice. The goal of this script is to automate the boring and time westful
rotine of coping and pasting data from one excel sheet to another.

   In order to generate the invoice it will need a data frame, an old invoice, and some specific information of each invoice, such as
invoice numbers, length of the data frame, and time period.
