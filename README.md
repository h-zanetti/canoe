## Invoice Generator:

   The goal of this script is to automate the boring and time westful rotine of copying and pasting data from one excel sheet to another.

   The invoice generator is a python script that will collect the data from a data frame with the impressions of a specific programmer from
a specific time period and generate a invoice based on an old invoice. 

   In order to generate the invoice it will need a data frame, an old invoice, and some specific information of each invoice, such as
invoice numbers, length of the data frame, and time period.
